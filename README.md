This is a project I made for my Android programming class in my second year.
I call it the ultimate camera.
It has features like:
- Using Google Face Detection Kit to detect your face.
- Add filters like Batman mask, Spiderman mask,..
- Fix contrast, balance, photoshop the image however you like after you take it.

This project was made using native Java code 
=> For Android only.
